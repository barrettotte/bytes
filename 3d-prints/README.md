# 3d-prints

Various things I've designed and 3D printed

I find it easier to store these in a repo instead of screwing around with sites like Thingiverse or Thangs.
This roughly follows the directory structure I use in Fusion 360.

| Path                                         | Date       | Description  |

| [laundry-handle/](./laundry-handle/)         | 2023-08-22 | Replacement handle for my laundry basket |
| [resin-designs/](./resin-designs/)           | N/A        | Things designed that relate to resin printing |
