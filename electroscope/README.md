A simple beer bottle electroscope

## Summary

This device is just used to detect an electric charge on an object.

The first form of electroscope was made around 1600, called the Versorium.
The form of electroscope I made is known as a gold-leaf electroscope, even though I used aluminum foil instead of gold foil.

The leaves of the electroscope move due to electrostatic force and the amount of charge an object has
is proportional to its voltage.

Unfortunately, the electroscope is really primitive and really only gives you a vague idea on if an object is charged
and whether its a small or large amount of charge.
Another device called an [electrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrometer) actually provides a quantitative measure of electric charge.

I tested the electroscope by rubbing a foot long 1/2" diameter PVC pipe with a dish towel to generate charge via the [triboelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboelectric_effect).

- Aluminum foil for collector and leaves
- 8mm long 1.5mm inner diameter magnet wire
- Beer bottle cut below glass weld point, preferably clear
- 3D printed
  - [bottle-mid.stl](bottle-mid.stl)
  - [collector.stl](collector.stl)

## Build Notes

The shape of the leaves somewhat contributes to the readings. 
I found that leaves with a little more surface area provide a more noticeable indicator.
I ended up drawing two circles with diameter of around 27mm (a water bottle cap) and connected them with a curve.

The copper wire connecting the collector bolt to the leaves should be sanded down on both ends to remove enamel.
After connecting, do a continuity check between leaves and collector using a multimeter.
